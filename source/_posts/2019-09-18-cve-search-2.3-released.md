cve-search v2.3 has been released including many bugs fixed and a new support to the NVD/NIST format in
JSON. The new NVD/NIST JSON replaces the XML format which will be deprecated very soon. We welcome feedback
or contribution to improve the support of the new JSON format. The current support includes all the original
functionality from the original XML format with some improvements.

Thanks a lot to all contributions who helped us by reporting issues, proposing pull-request or supporting us.

Don't hesitate to review the [cve-search Changelog](https://www.cve-search.org/Changelog.txt) to have a detailed overview of what changes in 2.3.
