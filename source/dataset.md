# Open Data Feeds

Besides the software behind the cve-search project, our aim is to provide open data feeds. With the new [vulnerability-project](https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org/) project, all the dumps are available and accessible.

# Open Data Feeds of Software Vulnerabilities

- [https://vulnerability.circl.lu/dumps/](https://vulnerability.circl.lu/dumps/) - updated daily

This includes all the sources from the [vulnerability-project](https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org/).

There is also an [Open API to gather additional metadata from the actual vulnerabilities](https://vulnerability.circl.lu/api/).
