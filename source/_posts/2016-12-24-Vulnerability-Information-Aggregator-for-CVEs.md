Software vulnerabilities and CVE are usually relying on many third-parties sources for cross-references, additional information or validation.

We recently introduced [VIA4CVE](https://github.com/cve-search/VIA4CVE) - Vulnerability Information Aggregator for CVEs.

[VIA4CVE](https://github.com/cve-search/VIA4CVE) is an aggregator of the known vendor vulnerabilities database to support the expansion of information with CVEs. VIA4CVE is a companion to cve-search.

[VIA4CVE](https://github.com/cve-search/VIA4CVE) generates a compiled JSON file containing the CVE which all the known references.

The following references are already included:

* [D2sec](https://www.d2sec.com)
* [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
* [Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert](http://www.arcyber.army.mil) - (IAVM)
* [Microsoft Bulletins](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletins.aspx)
* [Open Vulnerability and Assesment Language](https://oval.cisecurity.org/) - (OVAL)
* RedHat information including packages associated to vulnerabilities
* [MITRE Reference Key/Maps](https://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/) - source MITRE reference Key/Maps
* [Saint exploit information](https://www.saintcorporation.com)
* [MITRE Vendor statements Collection](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
* [VMWare Security Advisories](https://www.vmware.com/)

A raw feed of VIA4CVE is also available at [https://www.cve-search.org/feeds/via4.json](https://www.cve-search.org/feeds/via4.json).

VIA4CVE is a companion to the [cve-search core software](http://www.cve-search.org/software/#cve-search-core).

We welcome software and hardware vendors to inform us about new sources.
