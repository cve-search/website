cve-search core team (including [adulau](https://twitter.com/adulau) and [pidgeyL](http://www.twitter.com/pidgeyL)) will be
at the [Open Source Security Software Hackathon](https://hackathon.hack.lu/) which takes place in Luxembourg (Kirchberg),
the 2nd and 3rd of May 2017. If you want to meet us, work with us or contribute to [cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/)
, it's a great opportunity to meet us in real life.

During hackathon, the cve-search core team has some objectives:

 - Testing and merging the current development branch which has significant improvements in the API and web interface into the cve-search master branch.
 - Updating the model of release and development to ease collaboration to the cve-search project.
 - Improving documentation and overview to describe the full scale of open data challenges in vulnerability information ([VIA4CVE](https://github.com/cve-search/VIA4CVE)). A call is made to vendors (including security vendors) to release vulnerability information into open format with a license allowing the integration with open source and free software projects.
 - and the most important aspect, distributing cve-search stickers ;-)

We hope to see you there. If you cannot join us physically, we will be in the [gitter chat of cve-search](https://gitter.im/cve-search/cve-search).
